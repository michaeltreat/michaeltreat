### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Michael Treat! I spent the last three years at Microsoft working on the Internet Explorer and Edge Browsers! I got to work on areas such as Network, Navigation, Downloads, Security Zones, Infastructure, Layout, and DOM Tree Rendering! It was an amazing, immersive experience and I learned so much from it.

I'm currently looking for a new role as a Software Engineer.
