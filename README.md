# üëãHello There! 

My name is Mike. I'm a software engineer with experience working with the JavaScript MEARN stack and with C/C++. I recently enjoyed 3 years at Microsoft where I completed servicing work on the Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer browsers!

This page is here to help you get to know who I am and what I value, and to share some of my expereiences, writings, and projects.


### üè´ School and Work ‚öíÔ∏è 
I attended Code Fellows Coding Bootcamp in 2017 where I learned Web Development using the MEARN stack, and where I worked at as a Teaching assistant there for over a year. 

I joined the Microsoft LEAP program's 10th Cohort in July 2018, and at the end of the 16 week program I was offered a full time position with the team I apprenticed on. I and began working for Microsoft in January 2019. I serviced security and non-security bugs and completed features in areas such as Network, Navigation, Downloads, Security Zones, Infrastructure, Layout, and DOM Tree Rendering.

## Who Am I?
_**As much as I love diversity and inclusion, I find it very difficult to include myself sometimes.**_ 

"In 5th grade I was voted recess mediator by my classmates. My role was to be a student advocate and to assist in resolving conflict on the playground. So, technically I'm completely qualified to carry the burdens of responsibilityüòÖ. Because of this experience I believe I started to learn how to be supportive and empathetic towards others very early on in my life, and it's one of the reasons why I'm so passionate about diversity and inclusion.
