# üëãHello There! 

My name is Mike. I'm a software engineer with experience working with the JavaScript MEARN stack and with C/C++. I recently enjoyed 3 years at Microsoft where I completed servicing work on the Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer browsers!

### üè´ School and Work ‚öíÔ∏è 
I attended Code Fellows Coding Bootcamp in 2017 where I learned Web Development using the MEARN stack, and where I worked at as a Teaching assistant there for over a year. 

I joined the Microsoft LEAP program's 10th Cohort in July 2018, and at the end of the 16 week program I was offered a full time position with the team I apprenticed on.
