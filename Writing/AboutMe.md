## Who Am I?
_**As much as I love diversity and inclusion, I find it very difficult to include myself sometimes.**_ 

"In 5th grade I was voted recess mediator by my classmates. My role was to be a student advocate and to assist in resolving conflict on the playground. So, technically I'm completely qualified to carry the burdens of responsibilityðŸ˜…. Because of this experience I believe I started to learn how to be supportive and empathetic towards others very early on in my life, and it's one of the reasons why I'm so passionate about diversity and inclusion.
